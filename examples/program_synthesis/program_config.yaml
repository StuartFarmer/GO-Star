query: "Write code that checks whether a list of integers is strictly increasing with no duplicates."
problem_context: |
  Read a single line from stdin. The line is a comma-separated list of integers.
  Output strict JSON: {"is_sorted_unique": true|false} and nothing else.
  An empty line means an empty list, which should return true.

  Pass all hidden tests. Prefer correctness over brevity.
